## Interpreting The Constitution

### Originalism Theory

The meaning of the Constitution does not change. If you want to change
the meaning, use constitutional power to amend.

### Living Constitution Theory

The meaning of the Constitution evolved with changing society.

### Reconciliation

Meanings don't change over time, but cases about forward looking
provisions can be decided that makes sense for today.

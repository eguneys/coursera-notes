## Legislative Branch

Congress is senate which represents the states, and house of
representatives, which represents the people. Congress legislates on,
issues that can't be left to the states, foreign affairs, and
enforcement of amendments against the states.

### Separation of Powers

Three branches share power to prevent one from gaining too much power.
Congress enacts the laws, president enforces the laws, courts decide
if laws are constitutional. Through checks and balances, all three
generally have to agree on a law.

## Executive Branch

The president enforces the laws, appoints federal judges with Senate
approval, conducts foreign affairs, and serves as commander-in-chief.
Presidents often expand their power during wartime or times of
national crisis.

## Judicial Branch

### The Supreme Court

Provides uniformity in interpretation of federal law and the
constitution, hears cases between states, can strike down laws. But
court enforces its ruling with help of other branches.

### Independent Judiciary

Under the constitution, judges can serve for life, unless impeached,
and their salaries cannot be reduced. People follow the Court's
decisions because they believe they are made without outside
influence. Courts play a key role in checking Congress and the
president.

"I don't want to be at the mercy of my emotions. I want to use them to
enjoy them, and to dominate them."

Negative emotions narrow and restrict our attention and behavior
whereas positive emotions broaden it.

Emotions have intensity levels between normal and impairing, such as
feeling anger and violence, sadness and depression, or happy and
mania.

Negative emotions should be controlled, right after we notice them, as
the time goes by it is harder to control them.

Be aware of the emotional triggers. Don't prevent emotions from
happening, but control them.

4 methods of controlling emotions:

* Identifying Labeling and Quantifying
* Relaxation
* Distraction
* Self soothing

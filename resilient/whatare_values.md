values isn't about always, being perfect, it means that when you
stumble, pick your self up.

Values are chosen life paths. The difference between values and goals
is, values are chosen life paths, and goals are achievements along the way.
Goals are informed by values.

Values and goals help guide our actions, and decisions. help transform
how we interpret our behaviors.

Under stress, one loses touch with it's values. Solution to this is
clarify values, be aware of behaviors, and stay committed.

you let the rope go, and be aware of the stress being in your daily
life.

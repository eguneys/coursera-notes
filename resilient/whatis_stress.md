Stress is hardwired in our brain.  Stress is anything that knocks us
out of our homeostatic state.  Amygdala is responsible for emotions and
stress, when it's activated, frontal lobe is deactivated. Frontal lobe
is responsible for making reasonable decisions.

Humans have a frontal lobe which allows them to think more deeply than
other mammals. Stressors can affect us over time. We can anticipate
stressors without them ever happening.

Stress, at the optimal level causes people to perform better, less or
more stress drops the performance.

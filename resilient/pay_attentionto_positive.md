People have a natural tendency to pick up on negative things, pay
attention to positive things selectively. This have the benefits of:
* more satisfying life
* more likely to build relationships
* able to cope better with stress
* able to bounce back from adversity
* better immune system, quicker recovery

We are not victims of our attention. Choose to pay attention to the
positive. Search for the silver lining, and choose to see the positive
in others.

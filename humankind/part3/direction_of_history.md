If you look at history in a large perspective, it is going in a
direction that is, unification of humankind. The first idea of
unification appeared in 200 B.C.

Three imagined realities are able to unite people, money, religion,
and empires.

Amount of money in the world is approximately 500 trillion
dollars. Only 50 trillion dollars are actual physical money, rest is
only computer data, in bank accounts.

Two principles of money are, universal convertibility and universal
trust. It is difficult to build trust in dollars without United
States, and it's also difficult to manage United States without
dollars.

Religion has answers to all the mysteries of the universe, while
science is the discovery of ignorance rather than knowledge. Science
simply says, "We don't know." to many questions about the universe.

In the past science and technology were separated. Militaries did not
invest in science to develop new technology. Physics or Chemistry were
not helping people win wars.

According to science death is a technical problem that has a technical
solution. In religion there is no cure for death, and people will have
an after life after death. Communists, Capitalists or Feminists
doesn't have any answer for what happens after death.

European empires supported geographical expeditions and
research.

Christopher Columbus found out first about America, but he
thought it was some small island near India, and called the local
people Indians. Later an Hispanic man named Americo claimed that there
is a new continent that people don't know about and drew it on the
map, that's where the name America came from.

Meanwhile, Asian empires or Muslims weren't interested in researching
the world geographically.

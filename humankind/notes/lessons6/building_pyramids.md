Why people dream about visiting foreign countries, and have vacation?
Because of romantic consumerism.

Romanticism is the idea of having as many experiences in life as
possible. Consumerism is the idea of consuming whatever you want. The
combination of these two ideas is the tourism. Tourism sells people
different experiences in foreign places.

Objective is something that exists independent of individuals.
Subjective is something that exists in the conscience of one
individual.  Inter subjective is something that exists in the
communication of many individuals.

Religion, nations, are inter subjective realities. In order to mutate
or destroy an inter subjective reality, a higher inter subjective
reality is needed.

After the agricultural revolution, people began building orders.  In
order to build an order, you need a lot of food, an imaginative
reality, and ability to process numbers, by means of writing.

The first writing in history was by Sumers about numbers accounting
goods.

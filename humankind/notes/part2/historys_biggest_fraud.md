Hunter-gatherers started to control other animals and plants, and
became peasants They began planting wheat all over the world. Wheat
domesticated hunter gatherers.

As the peasants became domestic, and began producing more and more
food, women had more babies and population grow. However life was
harder for peasants, opposed to hunter-gatherers, they had to work
longer and harder to produce more food for the population. Also the
animals and various garbage disposals infected people in vast amounts.

Agricultural revolution wasn't a single decision, but happened over
generations, and it wasn't possible to go back to the way before.

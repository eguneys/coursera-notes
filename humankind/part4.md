## Discovery of Ignorance

Religion has answers to all the mysteries of the universe, while
science is the discovery of ignorance rather than knowledge. Science
simply says, "We don't know." to many questions about the universe.

In the past science and technology were separated. Militaries did not
invest in science to develop new technology. Physics or Chemistry were
not helping people win wars.

According to science death is a technical problem that has a technical
solution. In religion there is no cure for death, and people will have
an after life after death. Communists, Capitalists or Feminists
doesn't have any answer for what happens after death.

## Marriage of Science and Empire

European empires supported geographical expeditions and
research.

Christopher Columbus found out first about America, but he
thought it was some small island near India, and called the local
people Indians. Later an Hispanic man named Americo claimed that there
is a new continent that people don't know about and drew it on the
map, that's where the name America came from.

Meanwhile, Asian empires or Muslims weren't interested in researching
the world geographically.

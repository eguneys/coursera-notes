In the past empire times, people were dependent on their families and
friends to survive. Today the governments support the idea of
individualism. That is people are not dependent on their families
anymore, government will give services to people that will let them
live independent.

Today wars are more costly, and less profitable, and meaning of peace
has changed it's meaning to impossibility of war. The Nobel peace
prize went to physicists that invented the nuclear bomb so the cost of
war has increased.

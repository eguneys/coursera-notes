## Direction Of History

If you look at history in a large perspective, it is going in a
direction that is, unification of humankind. The first idea of
unification appeared in 200 B.C.

Three imagined realities are able to unite people, money, religion,
and empires.

Amount of money in the world is approximately 500 trillion
dollars. Only 50 trillion dollars are actual physical money, rest is
only computer data, in bank accounts.

Two principles of money are, universal convertibility and universal
trust. It is difficult to build trust in dollars without United
States, and it's also difficult to manage United States without
dollars.

## Imperial Visions

Empires are the second imagined reality that unites people.
There are two arguments against empires that are problematic; empires
does not work, and empires are evil. Most of the peoples in the human
history are ruled by empires, so empires do work. Empires kill many
rebellions and force people under their rule, yet they are not pure
evil.

## Law of Religion

Religion is the third imagined reality that unites people.
* Animus, is believing in spiritual existence in the world.
* Polytheism, is believing in different gods that govern different
parts of the world, such as rivers, moon, rain and so on.  Roman
empire believed in polytheism and divinity of the emperor. They didn't
send missionaries or force captured people to believe in polytheist
beliefs.
* Monotheism, is believing in a single god. The Christians denied to
believe in polytheism and the divinity of the Roman emperor, and
Romans killed them. Romans killed thousand of Christians, yet the
conflict among the different groups in Christians resulted in millions
of deaths.

* There are other religions that isn't based on god. Such as Buddhism.
Buddhism believes that suffering comes from craving. In order to free
from suffering one must free their cravings and reach Nirvana. Nirvana
means extinguishing fire. The fire of craving. The Buddha has reached
Nirvana, and teaches other people about Buddhism.

For an imagined reality to be a religion, it mush be based on super
human laws, and it must order people what to do. Soccer has it's own
laws and it is practiced and followed by many people, yet it is not
based on super humans, it's laws are created by humans, thus it's not
a religion. Similarly theory of relativity is super human, yet it
doesn't enforce any laws upon people, telling what to do. Thus it's
not a religion either.

On the other hand, communism, liberalism, capitalism, and such are not
called religions, but ideologies. Yet they are not as less of religion
as Islam. They are too based on super human laws, and order people
what to do.

The modern religions are, based on monotheic religions.
* Liberal humanism: Believes in importance of individual people.
* Social humanism: Believes in importance of social order, and communities.
* Evolutionary humanism: Is not based on monotheic religion, but based
  on evolution. Followed by Nazi's, the goal is to embrace natural
  selection and eliminate the weak races, such as Africans, Indians,
  mixed brews, disabled people and so on, and select only the purest,
  fit races to survive.
